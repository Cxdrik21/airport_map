## Lab 3: Designing a Web map

**Intro**
This lab focused on practicing web development skills to utilize HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery to create an interactive web map displaying information about airports in the United States. The map generated in this project was made possible with data provided by the USGS and Mike Bostock of D3. The spatial data library Leaflet provided the framework for the software behind the map while the basemap was created by CartoDB.

**Map**
The map in particular puts two separate datasets into action: The first are points representing airports in the United States, symbolized by the presence of a control tower or not. The other dataset shows the number of airports under investigation by state. States with more airports are represented by lighter colors while darker colored states have less airports under investigation.

**Code**
The map is largely constructed with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and jQuery. Various libraries were brought in to make the styling and interactivity possible like leaflet and Ajax. Functions were used extensively to add color, pop-ups, and style the various map elements.
